## Day 4 - 20/05/2023 - Motion Sensor Glory

The PIR sensor (passive infrared sensor) was first in line to be experimented with. For no reason other than the fact that it looked cooler than the others.

My box of sensors was a relatively cheap one from Amazon, but they come with downloadable manuals, which I'm quite relieved about because I did not know what on Earth I was looking at. It's pretty funny coming from an arts/humanities background to IT because even the idea that each of the pins on the pi have a different job is absolutely mind blowing.

### Job One - Wiring 
For this, I had to use ~~Penelopi's hair~~ wires to connect the pins on the pi to the pins on the sensor.

| PIR | PI | Wire  | Why                                                     |
|-----|----|-------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| VCC | 2  | red   | Provides power to the sensor                            |
| OUT | 8  | blue  | Data outputs from the PIR and gets sent to the this pin |
| GND | 6  | black | Grounds...                                              |

### Job Two - Fiddle with the Trimpots
There are two - one for sensitivity (between 3m and 7m), and one for delay (between 5 and 300 seconds). I wanted the delay as short as possible, so turned it all the way anti-clockwise. The delay is still 5 seconds, which is frustrating when you try to test it, because you have to wait 5 seconds before it'll try to detect again, but it's workable.

### Job Three - Codey Code

I started by using the code in the sensor manual. It did not work. Luckily, it uses the RPi.GPIO library and there's documentation it. I used this to build everything up from scratch. I started by just trying to detect any kind of input from the sensor to see what kind of data was coming in. Turns out it's as simple as 0 for inactive/no movement and 1 for active/movement.

After this, I looked at how to detect changes in input. I wanted to know when it went from 0 to 1, because this suggests that something moved. Turns out this is a 'rising edge', and going from 1 to 0 is a 'falling edge'. I created a risingHandler method that just prints a message. Then, used the event_detect method to attach the risingHandler method as a callback when the rising edge is detected.

Because you need the script to keep running in order to detect the events, I cannibalised the while loop from the PIR manual which just has a sleep cycle that keeps the program alive.

I've heavily commented the code to show what's going on.


### Extra Fun 

On my way through this process, I had a little delve into the differenc between BOARD and BCM pin numbering and decided to use BOARD. BCM changes between versions and, while I'm not planning on getting a different Pi (given how difficult it was to get hold of this one), it seemed more stable to use numbering that was consistent.

I also had to look at the Python style guide because I could argue for days about naming conventions. Horrified to find that snake case is preferable for function and variable names, rather than camel case or pascal case.  Considering dropping the whole effort to learn Python. This might be the last entry here.
