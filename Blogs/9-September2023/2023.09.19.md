## Day 7 - 19/09/2023 - Flamin' Hot ~~Monster Munch~~ Sensors

### Before We Begin
I've been spending a fair bit of time recently on learning C and building smaller projects with it. I'm starting to have another look at the C libraries for interacting with the GPIO pins and manipulating memory, and trying to figure out what they're doing and how everything works. This is why there has been less Penelopi stuff of late. I tried to run before I can walk, thinking that I could replicate a library, but I've been put in my place and I'm now learning to crawl.    


### Setting Up
Because there's nothing more safe than open flames next to electronics, the next sensor in line is a flame sensor!

Like the traffic lights, this uses AirSpayce's BCM2835 library [(AirSpayce)](http://airspayce.com/mikem/BCM2835/). I chose this one because it seems to abstract less than other libraries like WiringPi. I wanted something as close to bare bones as I could find. 

This uses pins 1, 7 and 9. 1 for power, 7 as an input and 9 for grounding.

### Codey Code

The code is [here](/CScripts/flameDetector.c).

This one actually took a while to code. I originally wanted to do this using edge detection, rather than constant polling for readings, as this would give me chance to use rising and falling edges. After setting pin 7 up as an input, I set it to pull up. Documentation for the sensor says that you get a reading of 1 for no flame and 0 for flame, so it made sense that you'd want any indeterminate readings to default to the higher value. I then set it to detect the falling edge, but I could not get this to work consistently- sometimes the prints were appearing at the right time and sometimes not. I tried all the variations of pullup/pulldown and rising/falling/high/low, but all this succeeded in was causing poor Penelopi to reset herself (I'm guessing setting it to pull down and then asking it to detect and print low readings caused carnage inside her).

I think I have more work to do on interrupts. 

In the meantime, we went to Plan B and resorted to polling for readings. Every half a second, the code polls for a reading. If it's a 0, we're on fire. 

As before, I used GCC to compile. This has turned out to be a real fun activity- I'm coding directly onto the Pi, and I'm trying to keep it headless and not fill it with unnecessary stuff, so I'm using nano (come at me vim fans) to write the code. In my daily software engineer life, I'm insanely reliant on intellisense, so I like to think that forcing myself to code without it, and only finding my syntax errors on compile will eventually make me less lazy as a programmer! 

Again, like before, I had to link in the BCM2835 library, so the command looked like this:  
gcc -I ~/PenelopiProjects ~/PenelopiProjects/BCM2835.c flameDetector.c -o flameDetector  

In the end, the whole thing looked like this!
