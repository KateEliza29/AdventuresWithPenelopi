## Day 6 - 10/07/2023 - Do You C?

### Before We Begin
So I have the greatest criticism for the [Rpi.GPIO Python library](https://pypi.org/project/RPi.GPIO/). It's so well written and easy to use, it makes the whole GPIO programming thing way too easy. There seems like no point in going through all of my sensors and using this library to hook them up. I'm not going to learn anything new, and this blog would get very repetative.

Abstraction is great, unless you really want to understand what you're doing.

So... We're taking a diversion and I'm learning C, with the aim of directly interacting with the GPIO pins. I've worked through a couple of online courses (thank you Pluralsight) and I've successfully written, compiled and executed a Hello World, so I'm basically an expert now.

Also, as a fun aside, I've changed internet provider which has caused havoc with poor Penelopi. I didn't think about it until I just switched her on, tried to ssh onto her and realised she was not connected to my wifi. Because she's headless, I took the microsd out, reinstalled the OS and preconfigured it with the new wifi details. Probably quite useful since it's got rid of all the Flask debris that was left after the last couple of experiments.

I had a bit of fun with the ssh fingerprint though. When you first ssh onto a machine, it confirms the fingerprint and saves this into the known_hosts file, which is checked on subsequent ssh attempts. Because I'd kept the same hostname, but everything else had changed, there were errors and I had to delete the key from known_hosts. Learned something new about ssh today.

Anyway, here are traffic lights being controlled by C code.

### Oh, I C
To gently ease myself into the scary world of C, I decided to replicate what I'd already done, but with a C library instead. The code is [here](/CScripts/trafficLights.c).

So, I downloaded AirSpayce's BCM2835 library onto Penelopi using wget, installed and configured it using the instructions from [AirSpayce](http://airspayce.com/mikem/BCM2835/) and used their blinky.c example, along with my Python code as a starting point for creating the c code.

Up until now, I've been writing code on VS code on my Windows machine and then copying it into a Nano file on the pi. This time, because screw Windows and GUIs, I'm doing the whole thing in ~~the matrix~~ Nano.

With this project, I'm finding that I'm allowing myself to make bad practice decisions, and telling myself that it's ok because I know it's bad practice, but that I'd never do it on a professional project. This is a terrible, lazy attitude and I made myself fix one today. The BCM2835 installer puts all the files in a directory in the user's root. When I went to compile, I discovered that I had to reference the library file in the compile command, and, knowing that it would take a few compile rounds to get the program working, I decided to copy and paste the library file into the project folder so that the path in the compile command was shorter. However, if I ever updated the library, I'd have to copy and paste it into whichever project folders I was using it in, which would get messy and I've have mismatched versions all over the place. Plus, you can just press the 'up' key to rerun a command.

I've actually just run them through a character counter. They're both 92 characters! It was probably more effort to copy and paste. Don't be lazy, kids.  
sudo gcc -I ~/PenelopiProjects ~/PenelopiProjects/BCM2835.c trafficLights.c -o trafficLights  
sudo gcc -I ~/PenelopiProjects ~/BCM2835-1.73/src/BCM2835.c trafficLights.c -o trafficLights

I wondered if I'd fall into a trap with BCM and BOARD pin numbering at some point, and it turns out that this is where it's happened. I'm sure the clue is in the name, but the BCM2835 library uses BCM pin numbering. My traffic lights use 11, 13 and 15. These map to GPIO 17, 27 and 22. However, I couldn't get the yellow light (13/27) to work. I ended up looking at the library code and finding out that their standard mapping maps 13 to 21, which means that my pin board is a different version to what they were using when they wrote it. Luckily, they have a V2 set of mappings, which does map 13 to 27.

Now that I've got these working, and I'm getting a bit more comfortable with writing and compiling C, I'm going to read through the library code and try to rewrite my program in pure C. Given that the fun of embedded programming is making your programs as concise and as lightweight as possible, I don't want to have to include a whole library when I'm only using a couple of functions. Yes, Penelopi can cope with a lot, but other microcontrollers may not have the space for a library, so we're going to put my program on a diet.
