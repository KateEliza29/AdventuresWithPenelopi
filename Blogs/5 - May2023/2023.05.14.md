## Day 3 - 14/5/2023 - The Flask Saga
Before we start, the wires arrived, and Penelopi has a snazzy new station to keep all of her bits together. Thank you IKEA. <br>

As a result of tonight's work, there is now a working web server running an interactive Flask application. All the code for this part is in the flask_project directory. 

### The Flask Saga - Part One
I started with getting Flask set up on my dev machine (which is Windows - I have a laptop with a Linux partition on it, but for some reason I always end up using my main machine instead). Process was along the lines of: 

1. Download and install python. 
2. Create the project folder.
3. Create a virtual environment folder and activate the environment. 
4. Install flask using pip. 
5. Install flask-wtf so I could use snazzy form stuff. 
6. Create the app.py file, a couple of html templates in a separate template folder and a forms.py file to hold the form classes.

At this point, I had a fun little error where VS Code couldn't resolve the Flask import. Turns out I had two python installs - one global and one within the virtual environment. In the bottom right of VS Code there is a little button that allows you to change which python install it's using.

I'll admit that building the application took me a flippin age. For some reason, the submit button would only do a GET request, and I could not get any parameters to be passed anywhere. Eventually, I came across some stuff about Flask WTF (a form library), which also suggested storing the form data in a session variable, which solved my problems. 


### The Flask-Saga - Part Two
Once the application was built and working locally, it was time to move it to Penelopi and get it running externally.

To begin with, I went about this in the same way as I did on my windows machine (ie. create project folder, virtual environment, scp my folder structure in). Following a tutorial, I installed gunicorn and tried to configure all that shizzle and point my nginx server at it. Again, could not get any of this config to work. There were issues with gunicorn being installed globally and not in the virtual environment, which messed up the proxy, and issues with setting up systemctl services. Everything seemed overcomplicated, which, in my experience, generally means there's a better way (although this is my first time working with nginx/gunicorn/python/flask so what do I know?).

Turns out there was an easier way. Process followed was: 
1. Create project folder. 
2. Create templates folder and use touch/nano to create the Index.html and Result.html files. No scp this time, to avoid any conflicts with dependencies/versioning that might cause problems. 
3. Install python, flask, gunicorn, flask-wtf.
4. Don't bother with the virtual environment malarky. Create an __init__.py file and put all the stuff that was in app.py (the routing, basically) in there. 
5. Create /ect/nginx/sites-enabled/flask_project and make sure it's pointing at my external ip. 
6. Unlink the /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default, because you want the flask_project one to replace it. 
7. Restart nginx. At this point, I saw a bad gateway error because nginx was pointed at the internal ip that gunicorn would be running the application on, but gunicorn was not yet running the flask project. 
8. In the project's parent folder (in my case, this was SweetiePi's home directory) run the following command to assign gunicorn 3 workers and to set the application that it should run. 
	gunicorn -w 3 flask_project:app
	
At this point, a refresh of the website showed it was working. Celebratory tea was made.
