## Day 5 - 26/05/2023 - No Likey, No Lightey

For the next experiment, I wanted something that users could interact with over the web interface. Cue, traffic lights!

### Job One - Wiring 
This time, the sensor had separate pins for the red, yellow and green lights (and grounding). These needed connecting to the following Pi pins. 

| TL  | PI  | Wire  |
|-----|---- |-------|
| G   | 11  | green |
| Y   | 13  | yellow|
| R   | 15  | red   |
| GND | 9   | black |

### Job Two - Sensor Codey Code
This time, the pins needed setting up as output pins. This is because we're sending bools from the pi to the sensor to tell it whether to switch the light on or off.

I then send 'True' to whichever light we want to switch on, and 'False' to switch it off. I also added a sleep function and then an auto switch off for every time a light is switched on. And, because I like proof, there are some console logging statements in there to log each action. 

### Job Three - Website Codey Code
[Project is in here](/PenelopiWebsite)

I decided to create a new flask application to reinforce what I learned the first time I did it, but, straight off the bat, I hit an issue. My computer decided that it did not have python or pip installed. It clearly was installed, but running the console command to figure out which version was installed turned up empty, and visual studio code was not recognising python, regardless of which path I pointed it at. 

The solution to this was the PATH variable. I went to Control Panel -> System and Security -> System -> Advanced system settings -> Environment Variables, and added Python's path (C:\Users\IAMAUSERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\PythonVersionWhatever) to the system variable. Closing and reopening the console and rerunning the version command showed it was now registering proeprly.

I also had to add C:\Users\IAMAUSERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\PythonVersionWhatever\Scripts to make pip work so I could install Flask, since that wasn't being recognised either.

After sorting this out, the site was relatively simple. I decided to add a bit of CSS to this one. Turns out that any static files like css or js need to be in a specific 'static' folder because of how jinja parses the site.

Setting up the routes was also a little easier this time. I took out the wtf library and just returned the same index page each time with a different confirmation message depending on what the user had clicked.

### Job Four - Making it Live
I set this up in the same way as I did before, only this time, I unlinked the flask_app. So, I went into the parent directory and ran:
	gunicorn -w 3 PenelopiWebsite:app 

The live site appeared on my external IP. As soon as my trusty external tester confirmed it was working from outside the house, celebratory tea commenced.
